# 👋🏻 Hello there, I'm Teodor 👨🏻‍💻

### Bio
By day, I am a Games Programmer Student at the University of Northampton. When I am not studying I am most likely **coding for [ZeoFlow](https://zeoflow.com/team/teodor_g)(@zeoflow)**, **hacking on side projects(@almt-uk)**, **creating open-source software**, chatting with my friends or travelling.

### What I'm working on
I'm working on ZeoFlow Development (including website/android app/database/backend) and Quest-Mode (educational website)

### How sponsorship helps me
I am currently studying my bachelor degree in games programming as full-time and besides that, I am working at open source projects too, therefore all my contributions are done in my free time. Sponsorship helps me cover some bills, save time with the dinner tiers and keeps me working open-source without having a job. You can view my sponsorship page <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/TeodorHMX1">here</a>.

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup) and GraphQL. I recently was selected to be an inaugural <a href="https://stars.github.com/">GitHub Star 🌟</a> based on my involvement in the tech community.  My interest in the React ecosystem led me to launch <a href="https://www.meetup.com/React-Ladies/">React Ladies</a>, a community for women and non-binary ReactJS developers.
